Project for ECE 188: Applied & Interactive Machine Learning (UCLA Spring 2021)

The compiled app can be found in [releases](https://github.com/RyGuy101/TinyType/releases/tag/master).

This project is based on this template I made for web apps: https://github.com/uas-at-ucla/electron-typescript-react-redux-skeleton
